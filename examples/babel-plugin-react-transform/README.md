# Delicate error reporter demo

Almost every line of code shamelessly borrowed from [React Transform Boilerplate](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-boilerplate).

## Run

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ open http://localhost:3000/
```

## What's inside

* [react-transform-webpack-hmr](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-webpack-hmr) handles hot reloading
* [react-transform-catch-errors](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-catch-errors) catches component errors (within `render` method) and displays them with the help of [delicate-error-reporter](https://github.com/aulizko/delicate-error-reporter)
